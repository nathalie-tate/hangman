Homework Assignment 1 "Hangman"

The following instructions are for Linux. This program should work on other
operating systems, but it is not guaranteed.

To Build:
cd to this directory (Assignment1_nathalie_tate)
run `javac Hangman.java`

This will generate a large number of .class files. Sorry, it's kind of annoying.

To Run:
cd to the parent directory (the directory containing the `Assignment1_nathalie_tate` directory)
run java `Assignment1_nathalie_tate/Hangman`
